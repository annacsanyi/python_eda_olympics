## Olympic Medals EDA (1976–2008)
### Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Summer Olympics from 1976 to 2008.
The analysis aims to uncover trends in medal distribution, gender representation, host country performance, and the competitiveness of different sports.
The project was completed as part of my portfolio to demonstrate Python data analysis skills, including data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and critical interpretation of results.

### Key Questions
The analysis was guided by the following questions:
1. How has the total number of medals awarded changed between 1976 and 2008?
2. How has the number of female medalists evolved over time compared to male medalists?
3. Which sports are male- or female-majority in terms of athlete participation?
4. Which countries won the most medals overall, and do host countries tend to win significantly more?
5. Which sports show the widest distribution of medals across countries, and which are dominated by only a few?

### Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Highlights of Findings
- The total number of medals awarded increased by more than 50% between 1976 and 2008.
- Women’s share of medal-winning athletes grew from ~28% in 1976 to ~45% in 2008.
- Male-dominated sports (e.g., Wrestling, Weightlifting) remain more extreme than female-majority sports (e.g., Gymnastics, Volleyball).
- Hosting the Games often boosted a country’s medal share, with especially strong effects for the Soviet Union (1980), USA (1984), and China (2008).
- Some sports (Athletics, Boxing) are widely distributed across nations, while others (Softball, Baseball) are highly concentrated.
